# Cyberus
 A prototype cybersecurity tool created for the 22-23 Conrad Challenge. This Python desktop application allows the user to easily establish custom security responses in response to activity detected on the system.

I created this project in my Sophomore year at Westminster HS as part of the 2022-2023 Conrad challenge. I am the sole author of this program, but was lucky to have a team of my classmates to help with the marketing and design aspects of this project. Thank you Mr. Figs!

I doubt that this project is in any way secure or useful, but it stands as a solid example of my programming style in Python.

If you ever want to reach out to me, I'm always open at mercerweissx@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading!
